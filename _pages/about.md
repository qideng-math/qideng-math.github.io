I am a postdoc in [LIAM (Laboratory for Industrial and Applied Mathematics)](https://liam.lab.yorku.ca/) at York University since March 2024, working under the supervision of [Prof. Jianhong Wu](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=Ox-xAuIAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Previously, I was a visiting researcher at Wilfrid Laurier University from 2022-2024, hosted by [Prof. Yuming Chen](https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/yuming-chen/index.html). I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2023, advised by Prof. Zhipeng Qiu. 

My research focuses on mathematical biology, particularly in modeling sexually transmitted diseases, vector-borne diseases and theoretical immunology. My main interests and recent works include data-driven mathematical modeling, agent-based models, and deep learning. I have also worked on the theoretical analysis of ordinary differential equations and impulse differential equations, with a focus on stability and bifurcation analysis.
